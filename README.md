# Talking Clock Kata
We would like the text to be simple to read, so we will round the current time to the next full 5 minutes
(Definitely more convenient for the user than rounding down...).
We will use a 12-hour clock (e.g. 13:00 is "one").
For this particular clock we will not use "AM" and "PM", just the time
(and let the user guess which half of the day it is ;-) )

The time will be passed in a 24-hour format, and may contain (0, 0) as well as (24, 0).

For example:
- "12:00" should return "noon"
- "0:00" should return "midnight"
-
